Aquarium Monitoring System Datalogger
Overview
Welcome to the Aquarium Monitoring System Datalogger project! This system is designed to help aquarium enthusiasts and professionals maintain optimal conditions for their aquatic environments by continuously monitoring and logging key parameters.

Features
Real-time Monitoring: Continuously tracks essential water parameters such as temperature, pH, salinity, and dissolved oxygen.
Data Logging: Stores historical data for analysis, helping you identify trends and make informed decisions about your aquariumâ€™s health.
Alerts and Notifications: Sends alerts via email or SMS if any parameter goes out of the safe range, allowing for prompt corrective actions.
User-friendly Interface: Provides a web-based dashboard where users can view real-time data, historical trends, and system status.
Automation Capabilities: Integrates with other smart devices to automate tasks like feeding, lighting, and water changes based on the monitored data.
Components
Sensors: High-precision sensors for measuring temperature, pH, salinity, and dissolved oxygen.
Microcontroller: A microcontroller (e.g., Arduino or Raspberry Pi) to collect data from sensors and send it to the cloud.
Cloud Storage: Secure cloud storage for logging data and providing access from anywhere.
Dashboard: A web-based dashboard built with modern web technologies for data visualization and system management.
